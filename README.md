# Django Tutorial Project
This is my attempt at creating a Django project based on the official Django tutorial. It serves as a practical implementation and demonstration of the concepts covered in the tutorial. It covers the basics of setting up a Django project, creating models, views, and templates, and understanding the Django admin interface.
